# Power-Bi-Raw-Survey-Data- 
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes responses from a survey of 630 individuals working in the Data Analysis and Data Science fields. The goal was to extract meaningful insights and present them through a clean, interactive dashboard.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The raw survey data contained a variety of fields, some of which were irrelevant for analytical purposes. To ensure clarity and focus, I performed the following preprocessing steps:

Removed unnecessary data: Excluded columns such as Date Taken, User ID, Email, and Time to Complete Survey to protect privacy and streamline the dataset.

Generalized roles and industries: Consolidated niche job titles and industry terms into broader, more standardized categories for more coherent visualization.

Standardized programming languages: Cleaned and grouped variations of programming language entries (e.g., "Python", "R", "Java") under a consistent naming convention to analyze language popularity accurately.

📈 Dashboard Features
Using the cleaned dataset, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides insight into key aspects of the Data Analysis and Data Science workforce:

💼 Position Difficulty: Visualizes how respondents rated the difficulty of their current roles.

💰 Average Pay: Displays salary trends across different job levels and fields.

📊 Pay Satisfaction: Illustrates how satisfied professionals are with their compensation.

🧓 Average Age: Provides demographic insight into the age distribution of professionals in the field.

🛠️ Favorite Programming Languages: Highlights the most commonly used or favored languages among respondents.
